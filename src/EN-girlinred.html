                For this project, we had to make a music video. We had the to
                choose the music, so I decided to go with Girl in Red's Girl in
                Red's ‘Bad Idea!’, which I particularly like. which I
                particularly like. As for the colors, I stuck with red. For the
                video, I chose to put the lyrics above the extracts. For the
                characters, I wanted to represent a real person, unlike her
                partner, who is just a presence, to show that she is acting as a
                presence, but that there isn't a real person. presence, but that
                there isn't a balanced love, since the main the lead actress
                gives more love than she receives.
